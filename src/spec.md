# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add comprehensive school management features including photo galleries, teacher profiles, exam results portal, library system, fee payment tracking, and contact forms.

**Planned changes:**
- Add photo gallery system with four categories (general, events, achievements, facilities) and admin management
- Add teacher profiles displaying name, subjects, qualifications, contact info, photos, and office hours
- Add exam results portal where students view their grades and administrators manage all results
- Add library management system for tracking books and borrowing records
- Add fee payment system for students to view obligations and administrators to record payments
- Add public contact form for communication with the school and admin inbox for managing messages
- Update navigation menu to include links to all new sections

**User-visible outcome:** Students can view photo galleries, teacher profiles, their exam results, library catalog and borrowing history, fee obligations and payment history, and submit contact forms. Administrators can manage all these systems including uploading photos, creating teacher profiles, entering exam results, managing library books and borrowing, recording fee payments, and viewing contact messages.
